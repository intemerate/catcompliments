# compliments

a simple website that gives you random compliments with a cute cat that follows your mouse

## stuff

- random compliment generator
- animated cat cursor follower
- random cat images in the background

## credits

- cat sprites by [@crgimenes](https://github.com/crgimenes/neko)
- cat images from [cataas.com](https://cataas.com)

## how to run

just open `index.html` and thats mostly it.

note: the global counter needs the backend running
so if you want to test locally with the counter working, run the `npm install` then `npm run dev` and make sure you set the api url in index.html points to this =]] `http://localhost:6767/api/counter`
